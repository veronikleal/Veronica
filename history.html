<h1>The Origins of Isshinryu Karate</h1>
<img src="../../Veronica/images/insignia.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" height= "280px" alt="image of the official insignia of isshinryu karate">

<h3>Isshinryu means "The One Heart Way"</h3>

<h3>Isshinryu Karate (一心流) was founded in 1956 by Tatsuo Shimabuku in Okinawa, Japan.
    Master Shimabuku, born in 1908, trained under some of the greatest Okinawan masters — Chotoku Kyan (Shorin-Ryu), Chojun Miyagi (Goju-Ryu), and Motobu Choki (Motobu-Ryu) — before combining their teachings into one unified system.

<h3> Tatsuo Shimabuku created Isshinryu to be efficient, balanced, and realistic for modern self-defense.
    It blends:

    The speed and precision of Shorin-Ryu

    The power and breathing techniques of Goju-Ryu

    And the practicality of his own innovations

    Key features of Isshinryu include the vertical fist punch, snap-style kicks, muscle-based blocking, and training both sides of the body equally.
    Shimabuku’s philosophy centered on character development and harmony between mind, body, and spirit.

<h1>Arrival of Isshinryu to the United States</h1>

<h3>Donald Hugh Nagle, a U.S. Marine from Jersey City, trained directly under Master Shimabuku while stationed in Okinawa in the late 1950s.
    He quickly rose to prominence as one of Shimabuku’s most skilled American students and was later awarded his 10th-Degree Black Belt (Judan).

    In 1957, after returning home, Don Nagle opened one of the first Isshinryu Karate dojos in the United States, right in his hometown of Jersey City, New Jersey.

    Through strict discipline, deep knowledge, and respect for tradition, he built a strong community of martial artists who carried Isshinryu across the East Coast.
    He was widely respected as one of the founding figures of American Isshinryu Karate, blending Okinawan tradition with American perseverance.

<h3>For more than six decades, the Jersey City Dojo has stood as a cornerstone of authentic Isshinryu training in America.
    Founded by Grand Master Nagle and carried on by his students, the school has remained true to its roots while welcoming students of all ages and backgrounds.

    Training here focuses on more than just physical technique — it instills discipline, confidence, humility, and respect.
    Every class reflects the traditions passed down from Tatsuo Shimabuku → Don Nagle → Today’s Instructors.
